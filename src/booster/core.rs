/// The trait [`Booster`] defines the standard framework of Boosting.
/// Here, the **standard framework** is defined as
/// a repeated game between **Booster** and **Weak Learner**
/// of the following form:
/// 
/// In each round `t = 1, 2, ...`,
/// 1. Booster chooses a probability distribution over
///    training instances.
/// 2. Weak Learner chooses a hypothesis that achieves 
///    some **accuracy** with respect to the distribution.
/// 
/// After sufficient rounds, Booster outputs a combined hypothesis
/// with high accuracy for any probability distribution on training examples.
/// 
/// You need to implement 
/// 
/// - [`Booster::preprocess`],
/// - [`Booster::boost`], and
/// - [`Booster::postprocess`]
/// 
/// to write a new boosting algorithm.
