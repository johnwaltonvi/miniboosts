# `miniboosts/src/weak_learner` directory

This directory defines weak learners.
Weak learners are algorithms that take distribution over examples as input
and output a hypothesis with slightly better accuracy than random guessing.

The weak learners defined in this directory are listed below:

### Weak learners
    - [DTree](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Leo-Breiman/dp/0412048418),  
        Decision Tree.
        Defined in `decision_tree/` directory.
    - [RTree](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Leo-Breiman/dp/0412048418),  
        Regression Tree.
        Defined in `regression_tree/` directory.
    - GaussianNB,  
        Naive bayes algorithm.  
        Defined in `naive_bayes/` directory.
        **Note that current implementation is a beta version**.
    - WLUnion.  
        Sometimes one wants to use the union of multiple weak learners
        as a single one. This weak learner enables you to do that.


### `WeakLearner` trait
`core.rs` defines `WeakLearner` trait.
If you want to implement your own weak learner,
you must implement `WeakLearner` trait.

See the doc string for further information.
